## This directory contains my exercise about tables for Front-end Week 4

## Activity

Create a website that shows what you've learned in this week's course. Include information about the following:

- Compound selectors (Examples: ul ul { list-style-type : square }).

- Pseudo-classes (a:link { color : red } Applies when the link has not yet been visited, a:visited { color : green } Applies when the link has been visited, a:hover { color: yellow } Applies when the mouse is over the link, a:active { color : orange } Applies when the link is clicked).

- Pseudo-elements (:first-line/ ::first-line is a pseudo-element that consists of the first line of text in a block-level element, :first-letter/ ::first-letter is a pseudo-element that consists of the first letter of the text in an element).

- CSS positioning (position - fixed, relative & absolute, Navigation bar, float, clear).

- CSS - Display property

- Creating Layouts

- Positioning - Using float and a Container
